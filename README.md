*GameObject pooling example*

kPooling is an object pooling system for Unity. It is based on a flexible generic typed API and supports creation and management of `GameObject` type pools by default. kPooling also comes with a simple but powerful `Processor` API for adding pooling support for any C# type in both runtime and Editor.

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Kink3d/kPooling/wiki/Home) for more information.
